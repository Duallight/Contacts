# Contacts
A program to hold Contacts and all relevant information. 

This simple contacts program allows you to add, edit, search, and remove contacts in the list. It automatically saves the list to a file, and loads the file using serialization and deserialization. 

Each contact can either be a person or an organization, each having unique information fields.

TO DO:
Create a UI for ease of use.
Refactoring to improve expandability.
